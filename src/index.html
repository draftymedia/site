      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>Create and publish original, engaing content that informs, educates and entertains. Yeah, so, whilst our mission isn't, are content always will be.</p>

      <h2>Our ethos</h2>
      <p>We will always strive to be honest and not join in with the dumbing-down of content. Lying to you to get your clicks. We'll leave it to others to rehost others content.</p>
      <p>Content is one of those horrible catch-all words that covers everything but means nothing we're not sure what else to call it. Drafty Media doesn't write articles with an image here and there. Our CMA allows editors, writers and developers to create anything from reactionary quizzes to interactive storytelling.
